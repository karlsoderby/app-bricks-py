"""Base classes of the bricks running Edge Impulse models on the `arduino:edge_impulse` inference service.

`EdgeImpulseModel` holds the model and its connection for any input, `VideoInference` runs it on the frames of a
camera and serves the video with an overlay; the video bricks of the library build on them, and so can yours.
